                  a place they hate wihtout knowing why and teaching them subjecs
                  they don't like and won't use in their entire lives and wasting
                  12 years of their lives, Specialy nowdays there are literally
                  thousends of sources in different fields that are really "HELPFULL"
                  and might become a future cereer that pays off.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
                <h2>Books</h2>
                <p class="text">I started reading books four months ago, it's
                  one of the best decision in my life, books help you grow and
                  become a better person, (alhamdulillah) Books have changed me
                  and made me a better personal, because really i was such a "nowry"
                  before it, So far i've read 24 books in an average of one book a week
                  and i'm looking forwerd to increasing it, My faviourt auther is robert
                  greene, Two of my faviourt books of all time are atomic habits, And
                  48 laws of power (I recommend you reading them). </p>

                <h2>Self-education</h2>
                <p class="text">As i said i hate school as i explained earlier
                and i suggested a solution which is "SELF-EDUCATION", Nowdays
                knowledge is not exclusive for schools or colleges or academic
                centers in general, You literally have all the world knowledge
                in your pocket, You can learn and study any subjec you want
                on the internet, For me i studied english in school for 9
                years but couldn't hold a conversation, I studied in home for
                2 years and i'm ALMOST fluent, And now i'm studying spanish,
                Web development, Digital markerting, Math, Reading books,
                Reading quran, And studying engilsh all by myself at home,
                So why the fuck! should i go to school.</p>
